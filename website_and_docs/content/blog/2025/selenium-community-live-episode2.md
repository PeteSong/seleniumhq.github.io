David Burns, Selenium Project Leadership Member, Chair W3C Browser Testing and Tools Workgroup, Head Open source and Developer Advocacy at Browser Stack was the speaker for the episode. David spoke about Web Browsers and Browser engines, and how while automating them we should be aware of the underlying software we are automating, even the platform makes a difference!
